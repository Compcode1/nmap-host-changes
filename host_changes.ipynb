    "Ensure MacBook Air is on.\n",
    "Ensure iPhone (192.168.1.156) is on with Wi-Fi enabled.\n",

    "Run initial Nmap scan to establish the baseline of connected hosts and open ports.\n",
    "Observed Results\n",
    "No changes detected in the initial scan.\n",

    "\n",
    "**NOTES:** T\n",
    "\n",
    "he main Nmap protocol used in this project was TCP Service Version Detection (-sV).\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Nmap Command Used:\n",
    "nmap -sV -T4 192.168.1.0/24\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breakdown of the Nmap Options:**\n",
    "-sV (Service Version Detection):\n",
    "Scans for open TCP ports and attempts to determine the services running on them, along with their versions.\n",
    "This was essential for detecting changes in active services on devices over time.\n",
    "-T4 (Aggressive Timing Template):\n",
    "Speeds up the scan without sacrificing accuracy.\n",
    "Used to complete scans efficiently within the 5-minute interval.\n",
    "Why was -sV Used?\n",
    "This option allowed us to detect changes in services when devices were turned on/off or when applications changed (e.g., switching apps on a smart TV).\n",
    "It provided service fingerprinting, enabling us to see not just open ports but also what services were listening on those ports.\n",
    "Alternative Protocols Considered but Not Used:\n",
    "-sn (Ping Scan): Only detects active hosts but does not scan ports.\n",
    "-A (Aggressive Scan Mode): Includes OS detection and traceroute but was not necessary for this use case.\n",
    "-p- (Full Port Scan): Would have scanned all 65,535 ports but was excessive for our analysis.\n",
    "Thus, -sV was the most relevant Nmap protocol for tracking network service changes dynamically in this project.\n",
