**Nmap Automation with Dynamic Device and Service Changes**

**Project Introduction:**

This project automates Nmap network scanning via Python scripting] while dynamically modifying device states and network activity to observe real-time changes.

**Key Objectives:**

Detect how hosts appear and disappear on the network when Wi-Fi is toggled.
Identify service and port changes as different applications are used on a Smart TV.
Observe newly opened ports when enabling services like SSH and a local web server.
Use Python scripting to automate scanning and analyze results over multiple time intervals.
By automating Nmap scans and systematically altering network conditions, this project replicates real-world network monitoring scenarios, demonstrating how devices and services behave dynamically.
